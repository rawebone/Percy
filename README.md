# Percy

Percy (short for Persistence) is a tiny Active Record implementation designed
to provide a good enough solution to database access for general cases, and
with extensibility in mind for the future.

I've written it because I needed it, something small, concise, and clean for
my own projects. If this meets with your brief, zang!
